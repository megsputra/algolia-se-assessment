_This project was generated with [create-instantsearch-app](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app) by [Algolia](https://algolia.com)._
This project is inteded to show the usage of Algolia's search engine using a simple dataset of Bordeaux Wines (128 records).
Attempted by Mega Putra

gh-pages: https://megsputra.github.io/algolia-se-assessment

## Goal
Integrate Algolia to my project, set up configurations such that searching, filtering, ranking, sorting works accordingly based on what is specified below.

### What the users should be able to do / what I intend to accomplish
Searching: Users should be able to search by name of wine, type of wine, year, and domain (wine region).

Filtering: Users should be able to filter by the type of wine (red/white), year, price range, and wine quality (0-100) using the sliding bar. This also includes setting up these attributes for Faceting.

Ranking/Sorting: the default ranking rules provided satisfactory results without further configuration, but I added a custom ranking by quality where I display the best quality wines first for the customer.

Personalization Enabled.

Added French to the language since these are all wines from Bordeaux, France and all the names are in French.

These personalizations sufficiently provided the results/behavior that I inteded, I left the rest to default. 


### Other remarks / if I had more time 
- The time allocation is prioritized towards the search functionality and the configurations rather than UI/UX
- After the data is deduplicated the image attribute were somehow changed, I would like to investigate why and focus less on appearance
- A map for the domain (regions)
- Add a feature to sort by year and by price (Low to High, etc)
- I would learn CSS and how to make things prettier/more smooth
- I would make the code cleaner for the time given, I am not 100% sure about the best practices in frontend
- Recommended browser: Chrome

### Feedback
It took quite long for me to figure out how frontend works as someone who has never done any frontend work.
